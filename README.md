## iHeartRadio Project

This project is an example of react/redux best practices utilizing a slightly modified version of the create react app bootstrap to include SASS.

Use "npm install" from terminal and then start the app by running "npm start" and additionally running the server with "node server.js" in another terminal window.

Please note that this is also run with the browser having cross-origin security disabled for local development.

Production ready builds are generated with "npm run build".
